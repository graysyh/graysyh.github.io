## Research Assistants

The Social Cognition Lab offers opportunities for bright, motivated, conscientious students who want first-hand experience conducting psychological research. We conduct rigorous and in-depth laboratory studies that will give you invaluable experience for graduate or professional school admission or a career in research.

We recruit our research assistants during the summer and recommend applying during Aprilâ€“June to be considered for positions beginning in the fall semester. _Any applications we receive are currently being considered for the 2025/2026 school year._

If you are interested in volunteering as a research assistant, please contact Hannah Tran at **kawakamisocialcoglab@gmail.com**. In your email, please include your unofficial transcript, resume, and a short description of your plans for the next few years (1-3 sentences). While research experience is an asset, it is not a requirement to apply!
