The “Residual Tumor and Response to Treatment Laboratory” has four main goals.

**The Social Cognition Laboratory at York University investigates a variety of social categorization processes using diverse methods.  Some of the main issues we examine include:**

* How we perceive people from different social groups 

* How we react to intergroup bias 

* Strategies to reduce prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination
